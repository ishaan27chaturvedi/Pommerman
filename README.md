# Pommerman
Pommerman Game analysis code

We developed a Java agent for Pommerman, you can find that in the Pommerman-java_agent repo.

To improve the agent, we analyzed 50 games of each agent version and visualized them using different graphs and plots.

This repo is dedicated to the data analysis aspect of the project
