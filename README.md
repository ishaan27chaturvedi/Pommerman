# Pommerman Game Analysis and Visualisation 
Analyses the Games played by the pommerman agent giving you wins, losses, ties, cause of deaths, etc.

## Description

We developed a Java agent for Pommerman, you can find that in the [Pommerman-java_agent repo](https://github.com/ishaan27chaturvedi/Pommerman-java_Agent).
To improve the agent, we analyzed various features of 50 games for each agent version and visualized them using different graphs and plots.
This repo is dedicated to the data analysis aspect of the project.

The following features of each agent from all games were analyzed:
1. Wins, Losses and Ties
2. Deaths by bombs or collapsing walls
3. Intentional kills vs suicides
4. Bombs planted
5. Explosions and items destroyed
6. Movement tracking

The stats for these features were analyzed on the basis of per agent, per game, per mode and all games together.

View the notebooks for understanding all the graphs that were generated.
